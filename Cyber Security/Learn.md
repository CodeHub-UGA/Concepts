# Learning more about Cyber Security 

## Ethical Hacking 

Ethical hacking is fundamental to cyber security. It is an authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the entire system, network, and applications. The practice of ethical hacking is used by a majority of organizations in order to make their networks even more secure. You might also see ethical hacking be referred to as "White Hat Hacking" in contrast to malicious hacking, which is called "Black Hat Hacking". 

## What do Ethical Hackers look for? 

* *Injection Attacks* 

* *Changes in security settings*

* *Exposure of sensitive data* 

* *Breach in authentication protocols* 

* *Components used in the system or network that may be used as access points* 

## Why mention Ethical Hacking? 

If you enjoy hacking, or are interested in hacking, it is important to always make sure that you are using your skills for GOOD, and never in a malicious way. Remember, you want to be a White Hat Hacker!

## What can you do on your own? 

There is no one language that is considered to be the most secure, but begin to educate yourself on what is meant by secure coding, and get in the habit of implementing such practices when you begin to work on projects of your own. You are responsible for the security of your own code. Start with defining your file permissions - who has access to what, defining what you want to be public and private, keeping track of your file paths, and commenting your code is a must! If you comment your code, it will help you and those who have authorized access to the code maintain it. 

Some personal project ideas: 

* Check out the Keylogger program that is included in the CodeHub repository!

* Try to break a Ceasar Cipher 

* Practice packet sniffing 
  * What is packet sniffing? 
    * Packet sniffing is the practice of gathering, collecting, and logging some or all packets that pass through a computer network, regardless of how the packet is   addressed. In this way, every packet, or a defined subset of packets, may be gathered for further analysis.
      * A great tool for starting out with packet sniffing, if using the Linux/Unix system, is [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org)
