# Ethical Hacking 

Ethical hacking is fundamental to cyber security. It is an authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the entire system, network, and applications. The practice of ethical hacking is used by a majority of organizations in order to make their networks even more secure. You might also see ethical hacking be referred to as "White Hat Hacking" in contrast to malicious hacking, which is called "Black Hat Hacking".
