# Cyber Security

## What is Cyber Security? 

Cyber security, which may also be referred to as information technology security, is the practice of protecting systems, networks, devices, and programs from digital attacks. It is not only about protecting these systems, networks, devices and programs, but also recovering them if they do become victim to a cyber attack.
