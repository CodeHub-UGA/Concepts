# Cyber Security

## What is Cyber Security? 

Cyber security, which may also be referred to as information technology security, is the practice of protecting systems, networks, devices, and programs from digital attacks. It is not only about protecting these systems, networks, devices and programs, but also recovering them if they do become victim to a cyber attack. 

## What is a Cyber Attack? 

A cyber attack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization. Cyber attacks can be broken down into two broad types: 

* Attacks where the goal is to disable the target system, or knock it offline
* Attacks where the goal is to get access to the target system's data

There are 8 main types of cyber attacks: 

* *Malware* : Also known as malicious software, this refers to any kind of software that is designed to cause damage to single computer, server, or computer network. Malware attacks may render the computer or network inoperable, or grant the attacker root access so that they can control the system remotely. Common forms of malware are worms, viruses, and trojans.
