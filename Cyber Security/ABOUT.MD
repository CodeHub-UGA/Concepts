# Cyber Security

## What is Cyber Security? 

Cyber security, which may also be referred to as information technology security, is the practice of protecting systems, networks, devices, and programs from digital attacks. It is not only about protecting these systems, networks, devices and programs, but also recovering them if they do become victim to a cyber attack. 

## What is a Cyber Attack? 

A cyber attack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization. Cyber attacks can be broken down into two broad types: 

* Attacks where the goal is to disable the target system, or knock it offline
* Attacks where the goal is to get access to the target system's data

There are 8 main types of cyber attacks: 

* *Malware* : Also known as malicious software, this refers to any kind of software that is designed to cause damage to single computer, server, or computer network. Malware attacks may render the computer or network inoperable, or grant the attacker root access so that they can control the system remotely. Common forms of malware are worms, viruses, and trojans. 

* *Phishing* : This is a technique by which cyber criminals craft emails to fool a target into taking some kind of harmful action. The recipient of a phishing email is often tricked into dowloading malware, which then gives the attacker access to sensitive information. These emails are sent to a great number of targets, in hopes to extrapolate useful information from those who might not have knowledge that they are the victim of a cyber attack. 

* *Ransomware* : This is a form of malware that encrypts a victim's files, after which the attacker dmands a ransom from the victim to restore access to their data. The amount of money requested by the attacker can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, and payment might also be requested in the form of cryptocurrency. 

* *Denial of Service* : This is an attack which attempts to stop some online service from working properly. For example, attackers might send a large amount of traffic to a specific website so that it overwhelms the system's ability to function, making it unavailable for use. 

* *Man in the Middle* : This is a method through which attackers interpose themselves between the user and the web service they are trying to access. An example would be an attacker setting up a WiFi network designed to mimic that of a business. When the user logs onto this pseudo-network, the attacker then has access to all of the user's information stored on their device. 

* *Cryptojacking* : This is a specialized attack that involves getting someone else's computer to generate cryptocurrency. The attacker will either install malware on the victim's computer to run the necessary calculations, or run the code in JavaScript which can be executed in the victim's browser. 

* *SQL Injection* : This is a means by which an attacker can exploit a vulnerability to take control of a victim's database. Because many databases are designed to obey commands written in the Structured Query Language (SQL), an attacker can write SQL commands into a web form which can then be executed on a website's database if it is not programmed securely. 

* *Zero-Day Exploits* : These involve vulnerabilities in software that have yet to be fixed. The name zero-day exploit comes from the idea that when a patch, or a softawre update that is meant to fix these vulerabilities, is released, each day reperesents fewer and fewer computers open to attack as users download the software update. Techniques to execute zero-day exploits are bought and sold on the dark web, and some are even used by government agencies for their own hacking purposes. 

## Elements of a Secure Information System 

* *Network Security* : The process of protecting the network from unwanted users, attacks, and intrusions

* *Application Security* : Applications require constant updates and testing to ensure these programs are secure from attacks

* *Endpoint Security* : Remote access is a necessary part of business, but can also be a weak point for data. Endpoint security is the process of protecting remote access to a user's network. 

* *Data Security* : Inside of all networks and applications is data. Protecting a user's information is another level of security that is necessary for having a secure information system. 

* *Identity Management* : A process of understanding the access every individual has in an organization i.e. Who can log into what?, Who has access to what data?, etc. 

* *Database and Infrastructure Security* : Everything in a network involves databases and physical equipment, which need to be protected. 

* *Cloud Security* : Many files are stored in digital environments. Making sure that "the cloud" is secure presents a great deal of challenges. 

* *Mobile Security* : Cell phones and tablets must be secure, which is a challenge in and of itself. 

* *Disaster Recover & Business Continuity Planning* : In the event that a cyber attack takes place, there needs to be a plan for what to do next. In addition, it is important that users of a network are educated in regards to practicing safe habits (double verification passwords, changing passwords, etc.) in an effort to be preventative. A lot of cyber attacks could be prevented if people were educated on how make personal efforts to keep their data safe on a network. 

## Why is Cyber Security important? 

* Today, now more so than ever, cyber security is important because government, military, corporate, financial, medical, and other organizations collect, process, and store an unprecedented amount of data on computers and other devices. Much of the data that is stored is sensitive information, whether it be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data that if given unauthorized access could have negative consequences. 

* There are more devices than there are people in our society today, which means that creating secure networks is becoming more of a challenge, as there are more entry points for a cyber attack to take place. 

* As technology becomes more sophisticated, cyber crimes are growing in sophistication as well. It is important that we always stay one step ahead of these cyber criminals in order to prevent cyber crimes from taking place.
