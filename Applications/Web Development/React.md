# React

## About
Created and maintained by Facebook, React is an ever growing javascript library for building user interfaces. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, multi-page or mobile applications. React is all about creating your web applications in a more maintainable way. It means you can write more apps with fewer bugs. And once you take the time to learn it, writing React is faster and much more fun, but donâ€™t take my word for it, do your own research and look at the data.</br></br>
