# Web development

## About
Web development involves creating web sites for the Internet. This comes in many forms such as a single static page of plain text to complex web-applications, electronic businesses, and social networking services. HTML and CSS makeup the building blocks of all websites, and are the first time any web developer should learn. Afterwards the World(WideWeb) is your oyster. Frameworks and libraries help you write shorter, cleaner code to get your next website online faster.</br></br>

## Back-Ends</br>
When it comes to the backend a good place to start is by looking into databases; look up the pros and cons of different database structures, when to use them and how this affects scalability. From there I would look into different backend programming languages (listed below), then frameworks for said langueges (also listed below). At that point, combine what you learned to build a simple RESTful API. The API is what connects the backend to the front end and as such, is a fundamental aspect of all web development.

## Full-Stack
If you're just starting, don't worry about what stack is best; choose one with technology you have the most experience with or interest in learning.
With that said here are some of the [Best Stacks for Web Development](https://medium.com/@systango/best-stacks-for-web-development-991f91b7f99c) </br></br>
MERN = MongoDB, Express, React, Node</br>
MEAN = MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node</br>
FERN = Google Firebase, Express, React, Node</br>
LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP</br>
LAPP = Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL, PHP</br>
Django stack: JavaScript, Python, Django, MySQL</br>
Ruby on Rails: JavaScript, Ruby, SQLite, Rails</br>
