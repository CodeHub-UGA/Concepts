# iOS Development

## About

Created by Apple and originally released as iPhone OS in 2007, iOS was designed for the iPhone’s touchscreen display. It has since been extended to the iPod Touch, iPad, and adapted to run at the core of tvOS, watchOS, iPadOS and CarPlay. Recently, Apple announced [MacOS Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/) allowing developers to create apps in one codebase and deploy across all of Apple’s platforms. Apple created a new programming language called [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) along with an IDE called [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for developers to easily create applications, and publish them to the AppStore. With an AppStore of over 2.1 million apps accessible from approximately 1.5 billion active devices, iOS makes up 18% of global market share and 60% market share in the US.
