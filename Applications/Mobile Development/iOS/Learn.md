**[Hacking With Swift 100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)** - By far the best one-stop-shop for any beginner to learn; this resource deserves to be at the top of this document. This site provides a step by step walk through of the Swift language, Xcode IDE, and SwiftUI. It’s content is broken up into short video tutorials, written guides and quizzes. It can be completed (in far less than 100 days) at your own pace and is filled with projects to build as you learn; I have done it and 10/10 would recommend it.

Prerequisites: All you need is a Mac running [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (free).</br>
