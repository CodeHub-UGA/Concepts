## About</br>
Bought by Google in 2005 and released in 2008, Android was designed for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and smart watches. It is based on a version of the Linux kernel and open source software allowing manufacturers to modify the operating system. Running on approximately 2.5 billion active devices, Android is the most popular mobile operating system worldwide. Google also created an IDE called [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for developers to easily create applications, along with the [Google Play Store](https://developer.android.com/distribute) to distribute them to all users on the platform.</br></br>

#### Prerequisites </br>
Android development can be done in mainly two languages, Java or Kotlin. The vast majority of developers “in the real world” still use Java so most of the resources will be using Java but can also be applied to Kotlin as well. You can learn more about the two languages and their differences as it pertains to Android development in the article [Kotlin Vs Java | A Comparison Between Two Powerful Technologies](https://techaffinity.com/blog/kotlin-vs-java/)  </br>
