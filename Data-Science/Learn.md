# Learning more about Data Science

## Statistical Analysis
### Fundamentals
(note that a lot of "calculations" can be done with R / Python)
* [The Basics](https://magoosh.com/statistics/statistics-basics-heres-what-you-need-to-know/) : The most basic elements of statistical analysis
* [The Basics (detailed)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) : If you have had little previous experience with statistics, this Khan Academy course will be super helpful for getting a basic understanding
* [Hypothesis Testing](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/) : How to test whether a hypothesis can be supported
* [About Test Statistics](https://magoosh.com/statistics/t-test-f-test-fundamentals-test-statistics/): understanding t-tests and f-tests
* [Types of Distributions](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/6-probability-distributions-data-science/) : an overview of the different ways data can be distributed
* [An Overview of Statistical Tests](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/statistical-tests/) : when a t test, chi-square test, etc. is appropriate
* [Confidence Intervals](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/confidence-interval.html) : the basics of confidence intervals
### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is most commonly used when analyzing datasets to find the relationship between variables. 
* [Simple Linear Regression](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/91/) : Basic explanation of how simple linear regression works
* [Multiple Linear Regression](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/131/) : Linear regression with more than one predictor variable. 
* [Variable Transformation](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/85/) : Sometimes, your data will not be perfectly linear or may have unequal variance, this article series explains when and how to transform your model into a linear one. 
* [Variable Transformation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIcqQhn3vSM) : This video explains how to use residual plot analysis to decide when to transform your predictor variables. 
* [Matrix Linear Regression](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/132/) : If you have a background in matrices or want to learn more in-depth, this is a more rigorous definitions of linear regression based on matrix principles. 

## Using Software
### Inputting Data

  * [Regression Output Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7TxjUI4PRI) : Short video series explaining the regression outputs in R. 
 * [Linear Regression in Python](dd) : This link explains how to do a linear regression in Python.
### Data Visualization 
 * [Data Visualization in R](https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/creating.html) : This explains how to create commonly used graphs/charts in R. 
 * [Data Visualization in Python](sdfsd) : This explains how to create commonly used graphs in R. 

## Dataset Sources
* [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) : Here you can find all kinds of publicly available datasets for a variety of topics, from the climate and economics to biology and eductaion.
* [KD Nuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html) : Contains links to a lot of publicly available datasets.

## Project Ideas
* Pick a dataset and analyze it!
