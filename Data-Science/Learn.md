# Learning more about Data Science
## Linear Regression
* Linear Regression is most commonly used when analyzing datasets to find the relationship between variables. 
* [Simple Linear Regression](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/91/) : Basic explanation of how simple linear regression works
* [Multiple Linear Regression](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/131/) : Linear regression with more than one predictor variable. 
* [Matrix Linear Regression] (https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/132/) : More rigorous definitions of linear regression based on Matrix principles. 
## R and Python
* R and Python are two commonly used languages for regression analysis and data visualization. 
* **R**:
