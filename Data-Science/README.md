## What is Data Science?
Data Science is a rapidly evolving industry at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and business. With the rise of technology and the availability of data, “more data have been recorded in the past two years than in all of previous human history” (Waller, 2013); additionally, data is available from more sources and in more forms than ever before. 

Data Scientists work to draw meaningful conclusions from such data through formalized approaches of analysis. Data Science draws on the analysis frameworks of statistics and the computing methodology of computer science to interpret data.

As industries become increasingly reliant on data with the rise of technology, the ability of data scientists to gather information from data becomes increasingly important for the future trajectory and growth of many industries.

## Tools
Data Scientists rely on both statistical analysis and computer science to gain insights from data. 
Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and R are very relevant.
