Don't know where to start? Check out FreeCodeCamp! It is a free website that can help you to build probjects.

Some ideas for your Personal Project: 

* Build a Website

* Re-design an existing website

* Design a basic game 

* Create a simple app (XCode, Java GUI, etc.) 

* Random Number Generator 

* Contribute to open source projects (contributing to an open source project gives you the chance to expand your network while making an impact in the coding community) - you won't have to think of a new idea, you can expand and contribute to the ideas others are already working on! 

# XCode 

XCode is an Integrated Development Environment, which means it pulls all the tools needed to produce an application (particularly a text editor, a compiler, and a build system) into one software package rather than leaving them as a set of individual tools connected by scripts. It is a great platform if you are interested in creating a functional application. Remember, it doesn't have to be too grand or complex - you can make it simple! 

* You can download XCode from the App store for free! If you are working on an Apple product, this is a great way to begin. 

* CodewithChris on Youtube has some great tutorials for how to get started on XCode, and they are super helpful! 

  * He has a 10 part series on how to create a beginner application, and I reccommend watching it, especially if you want to start with something simple and have a process you can follow!
