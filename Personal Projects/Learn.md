# Personal Projects 

# Resources that will help you to get started! 

Don't know where to start? Check out FreeCodeCamp! It is a free website that can help you to build probjects.

Need a platform to code on? Eclipse is great for Java Programming! Here is the link to download Eclipse, a JAVA IDE which includes Git integration for Eclipse, Eclipse Java Development Tools, Maven Integration for Eclipse, Mylyn Task List, Code Recommenders Tools for Java Developers, and Eclipse XML Editors and Tools.

Some ideas for your Personal Project: 

* Build a Website

* Re-design an existing website

* Design a basic game 

* Create a simple app (XCode, Java GUI, etc.) 

* Random Number Generator 

* Contribute to open source projects (contributing to an open source project gives you the chance to expand your network while making an impact in the coding community) - you won't have to think of a new idea, you can expand and contribute to the ideas others are already working on! 

# XCode 

XCode is an Integrated Development Environment, which means it pulls all the tools needed to produce an application (particularly a text editor, a compiler, and a build system) into one software package rather than leaving them as a set of individual tools connected by scripts. It is a great platform if you are interested in creating a functional application. Remember, it doesn't have to be too grand or complex - you can make it simple! 

* You can download XCode from the App store for free! If you are working on an Apple product, this is a great way to begin. 

* CodewithChris on Youtube has some great tutorials for how to get started on XCode, and they are super helpful! 

  * He has a 10 part series on how to create a beginner application, and I reccommend watching it, especially if you want to start with something simple and have a process you can follow!
