## What are Personal Projects? 

Personal projects are a great way to boost your resume, especially if you make them public in your GitHub so that possible employers can see your work! It will also show to employers that you are passionate about the field outside of work in class, and if you are not in a major related to computer science, they will showcase your coding skills! 

## How should you begin? 

* Start small! You don't have to make the next groundbreaking app on the App Store. Just work on implementing some small programs that will help you, and show off your skills as a programmer! 

* The first step, as with any project, is always to think of an idea. What is something you are interested in? A field you are interested in that you could incorporate into code? Maybe you want to learn a new language and showcase your proficiency with a small side project. Whatever your idea, the amazing thing about computers is that you can do anything and everything! 

* Choose a language that you know a lot about. Maybe you are well versed in Java, or Python is comfortable for you. Choose whatever language that is going to be most doable for the project you want to do. If you want to create an iPhone App, maybe you want to look into XCode. Something simple? Use Java or Python. Working with lists and storing data? Try C++ or C. There are so many languages and so many resources through which you can learn more about them!

* Start with the basics. What is the basic structure of your program? Start with creating an outline. What do you want your program to accomplish? List the steps through which you can accomplis your end goal. It is always easier to begin implementing code when you have a visual representation of how your code will run. 

* Once you have a simple design, start coding! Determine the classes, methods, and variables you will need for your program to run efficiently. Start with your constructors for your classes. If you have private variables (always practice coding safely), implement your getters and setters. Start with the basics, then get into your harder methods. 

* Keep testing! Make sure the basic functions work before you start anything more complicated. If you don't have a good base, your entire program will end up being more confusing to de-bug. Test your methods once you think you have implemented them. It will only help you in the end! 

* Don't get discouraged! If you are working alone, it is inevitable that you will encounter problems and errors in your code. And, if you are working on a collaborative project, you will run into these issues too! Don't throw the towel in. Go back to your resources, reach out for help, and even resort to Google to see how others might have implemented the same method you are trying to design. It is okay if it does not go smoothly at first, but you will persevere!
