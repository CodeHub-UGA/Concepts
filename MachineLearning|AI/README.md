# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence

## About Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

These three terms are often thrown around together, and sometimes it may be hard to differintiate between them. Here is an easy way to think about the relationship between these:

* *Artificial Inteligence* can be considered the entire universe of technology that exhibits or simulates anything like human intelligence.
* *Machine Learning* is a subset of AI that can learn by itself (the more date it recieves, the more accurate it can become).
* *Deep Learning* is a subset of machine learning which focuses specifically on deep neural networks.<br /><br />
