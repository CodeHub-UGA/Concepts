# Learn

Notes: 
* While you certainly do not need to be a an expert mathmatician, statistician, or programmer to start learning AI and Machine Learning, it is wise to understand that ML and AI will always heavily involve these fields. However, extensive knowledge of the fields is not necessary to begin (you gotta start somewhere right?).
* All coursera courses can be accessed for free by either choosing the free option when enrolling, or choosing *audit* to audit the courses materials for free (free versions do not include certificates or assignment grading)</br>

## Machine Learning Basics
